The dataset for the graph was compiled by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, an organization that focuses on tracking nuclear stockpiles worldwide and also details the global stockpile by country. The organization publishes a yearly "Nuclear Notebook," which details the stockpiles of each of the nine countries who have nuclear weapons. 

Nuclear scientists Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S. Norris are experts in this area of study and are the two main scientists who produce the "Nuclear Notebook," the individual country reports, and oversee the ongoing project.

I chose to begin the dataset in 1967 because this was the height of the U.S.'s nuclear stockpile. The total number of nuclear weapons the U.S. had at this time was 31,255. In comparison, the total number of nuclear warheads globally was 39,718. While the U.S.'s stockpile dropped significantly over the next 20 years, the global stockpile actually went up—peaking in 1988 at 64,099—as more and more countries developed nuclear capability. The largest drop in the U.S.'s stockpile was between 1987 - 1997, which is significant because this was the first decade after the Cold War ended.

Today, the U.S. holds the second largest stockpile - only behind Russia, who is in possession of 4,300 nuclear warheads. However, the U.S. still controls a large number of total warheads globally. The U.S. has 4,000 out of the 9,220 warheads distributed between nine countries around the world. Between both Russia and the U.S., the two countries are in possession of about 90 percent of the global stockpile of nuclear weapons.
