#### Question: Throughout 2017, how many civillains were killed from U.S. military strikes from the U.S.-led coaltion in Iraq and Syria?

I believe that this is a really important question to ask. The U.S.-led coalition has been operating against ISIS in Iraq and Syria since 2014 and there has been numerous complaints about rising civillain death rates from coaltion military strikes. These complaints are still ongoing; however, last year saw a lot of activity in the country with the liberation of Raqqa and Mosul from ISIS and the liberation of Iraq. Data from 2018 can be included as well, but I think that the data set is more interesting if examined in the context of a complete year. 

All of these figures are what the coaltion itself has reported. Because of this, there will need to be outside figures of the same data from independent war monitors examining the region for the actual article.

The data points I will be looked at are:
1. The month being reported
2. The total ammount of civillain casulties from that month
3. Month over month change of this figure
4. The total number of strikes that took place from Sept. 2014 (when coaltion military operations began) and the month of the report
5. Month over month change of this figure as well

I collected the data by going through the Monthly Civillain Casulty Reports that are released by the coaltion each month. The reports contain the total number of strikes and the total number of civillain casulaties since Sept. 2014, along with other detailed information about civillain casulty reports collected by the coalition.The growth figures can be found by doing a little math. 

There will be several points that will be incomplete for January and February 2017. The coaltion did not include the total number of strikes in these reports until February 2017. The figures for total number of strikes and growth over last month will not be filled in for January and the figure for growth over last month regarding total number of strikes will not be filled in for February. However, I believe these figures can be found by contacting the coaltion and speaking with a subject matter expert.
