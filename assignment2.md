Question: Are more people moving to Deschutes County, Oregon than Multnomah County?

Deschutes County is the last place I lived in Oregon. A common complaint from people who have lived there for years is how much the county, and specifically the city of Bend, is changing because of a large number of people moving there. I decided to examine if people are moving to Deschutes County at larger rates than Multonomah County, which is home to Portland â€” Oregon's largest city.

According to [the Census Bureau data set](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_2017_PEPTCOMP&prodType=table), Deschutes County had a total net migratiom of 5,772 people from July 1, 2016 - July 1, 2017. Multnomah county saw a signifcanlty less net migration than Deschutes during the same time span with a total net migration of only 2,534.

The data set does address the overall question at the county level. It does not show where within the county people have either left or have moved to. That would be a finer point that would make for a more interesting article. The data does come from a reliable source, the Population Division of the U.S. Census Bureau, and the same data can be found for every county in the country. While the data set is an estimate based off of the 2010 Census, it is calculated from a specific equation and [methodology](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology/2010-2017/2017-natstcopr-meth.pdf).

In order to estimate the net migration, the Population Division examines annual data from places like:
1. The International Revenue Service
2. Medicare and Medicaid services
3. Social Security Services

The division also examines migration of Armed Services personnel and uses goverment agencies to track yearly international migration. I believe that the data is coming from an extremely credible source, but information can be confirmed through the individual agencies if there are any questions about the accuracy of the data.
