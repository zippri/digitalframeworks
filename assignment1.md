# Assignment #1 #

I chose to do an article from [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/san-francisco-has-a-people-problem-1521691260) about how people are leaving San Francisco in large numbers despite the cities tech-company boom and thriving economy.

The article was able to use Census data to take a look at San Francisco in a way that you really don't hear about. The majority of the news about the city is regarding how well it is doing; however, Paul Overberg and Nour Malas show that more people are leaving the city than moving into it from other places in California.

The three main points that I thought the article could have done better are:
1. Connecting the data to a more personal element sooner into the article. The article talks about how S.F.'s population decreased by 24,000 people in 2016 and how rising housing costs are contributing to this. However, it is nearly halfway through the article before it makes a connection to the people who are being affected by this. The comibination of a strong economy, but a shrinking population "illustrates how people on the margins of the tech industry are squeezed outâ€”particularly senior citizens, workers in lower-wage jobs in other sectors, and young families looking for a less expensive start."
2. Adding a visual element to the article. There are a lot of seperate statistics and figures that are used in this articl: migration date, housing prices, birth rates, immigration rates, etc. It would have been nice to see a visual element added in the article. I think that a year over year graph showing the population in decline would have been really helpful for the article.
3. Using quotes from people who are being affected by this trend. The article uses a lot of quotes from experts. I would have tried to speak with people who have moved from S.F. recently or people who are still there, but struggling to remain there.

Overall, I really liked the article. It useed data that is able to be easily accessed and it showed a really unique story.
